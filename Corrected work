/*
 * 1. Are the following variable valid? If it is not please explain it and correct them using the est practise
 */

var 1stCar = 'Doge';
var var = 'variable';
var first name = 'Jerry';
var Sch00lName = 'MEST';
var totalnumber = 100;

Ans:
var 1stCar = 'Doge'; is not valid because a valid variable should only start with a letter not a number.
var var = 'variable'; is not a valid varibale because you cannot use the reserved js keywords as names.
var first name = 'Jerry'; is not a valid variable because a name cannot contain a whitespace.
var Sch00lName = 'MEST'; is a valid variable because a name can contain letters, digits, dollar signs, and numbers.
var totalnumber = 100; is not a valid variable because you must use camelCase as a good practice to make the names readbale. 

correct and best practice:
var car1st = 'Doge';
var y = 'coconut';
var firstName = 'Jerry';
var Sch00lName = 'MEST';
var totalNUmber = 100;

 */
var greeting  =  'It's nice to me you today!';
var response = "Ashwin said, "Yes Sir!"";

Ans:
var greeting = 'It's nice to meet you today!'; is not a valid variable because there was use of same quotes inside the string, 
use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string.
var response = "Ashwin said, "Yes Sir!""; is not a valid variable because use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string
