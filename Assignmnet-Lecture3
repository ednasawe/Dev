/*  1. Explain the following code:

 *      console.log(this);
 *  }
 *
 *  func(); // what is the output? Why?
 *
 *  var obj = {
 *      func: func // what is the second func here?

 *

 *  obj.func.bind(window)(); // what is the output? why?
 *
 *  obj.func.bind(this)();  // what is the output? why?

/* 2. write a function to convert first letter of every word in a string

 *     eg input = 'hi, welcome to mest;'

 *        input2 = 'today is Sunday';

/*
 *  3. Write reg expresion for email validation(This is not an easy 
 *  question, please make sure you do your research on this).
 *
 */

email validation can be done using regular expressions. 
function validateEmail(email) {
	var x = /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9[{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
	return x.test(email);
}


/*
 * 4. what is localStorage and sessionStorge under window object? What is the
 *    difference
 */
local storage is a web application that can store data locally within the user's browser. the storage is per origin(per domain and protocol).one can easily access the same data.

session storage store data for one session. Therefore, data can be lost when the browser tab is closed.
differences:
local storage                                          
1. is more secure
2. can store large amount of data
3. cannot affect the performance of the website
4. has no coockies
5. storage limit is large at least 5mb
6. information is never transfered to the server
7. all the pages from the origin one can be stored

session storage:
1. data can be lost once web browser is closed
2. has expiry date
3. it is almost equal to the local storage object
